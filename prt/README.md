# Spherical Harmonics

This project shows how to use spherical harmonics for pre-calculating lighting in 3D environments. Spherical harmonics are primarily useful because the irradiance (incoming light) can be stored very compactly, and rendered effeciently. The traditional solution for irradience is to encode lighting in cube or spherical texture maps. The spherical harmonics method can approximate a low-frequency cube map with just 9 floating point numbers.

I created this project for my mathematics capstone course. The end result turned out to be more of a programming project than a math one, but behind the scenes I learned a lot about the math as well. 

The demo is a [Literate Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming). Thanks to the creator of [Literate](https://github.com/zyedidia/Literate)

## Contents

- `demo/` - The C source code for the demo program.  Requires SDL 2 to build.

- `paper/functions.tex` - This paper introduces the theory of orthogonal systems and generalized fourier series from a mathematical point of view. There is no original research here. I wrote it for the purpose of understanding how Spherical Harmonics work. 

- `paper/laplace.tex` - This paper presents an organized way to transform Laplace's equation into spherical coordinates. Many differential equations textbooks mention that this can be done, but none of them actually show how to do it.
